      A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed
      to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to
      create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and
      access controls for that database. DBMS provides an environment to store
      and retrieve the data in convenient and efficient manner. Key Features of
      DBMS Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools for creating and modifying data
      models, which define the structure and relationships of the data in a
      database. Data storage and retrieval: A DBMS is responsible for storing
      and retrieving data from the database, and can provide various methods for
      searching and querying the data. Concurrency control: A DBMS provides
      mechanisms for controlling concurrent access to the database, to ensure
      that multiple users can access the data without conflicting with each
      other. Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing
      data integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values
      of data and access controls that restrict who can access the data. Backup
      and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and recovering the
      data in the event of a system failure. DBMS can be classified into two
      types: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and Non-Relational
      Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL) RDBMS: Data is organized in
      the form of tables and each table has a set of rows and columns. The data
      are related to each other through primary and foreign keys. NoSQL: Data is
      organized in the form of key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or
      column-based. These are designed to handle large-scale, high-performance
      scenarios.

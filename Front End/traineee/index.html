        <p class="para">Some of the benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after a session of
            moderate to
            vigorous physical <br>
            activity. Benefits include improved thinking or cognition for children ages 6-13, short-term reduction
            of
            anxiety for
            <br>adults, and enhanced functional capacity in older adults.Regular physical activity can keep
            thinking,
            learning,<br> and
            judgment skills sharp with age.It can also reduce the risk of depression and anxiety and improve
            sleep.

        <h2 class="header2">Benefits of Workouts:</h2>
        <p class="para">Routine physical activity is important for building strong bones and muscles in children to
            become Batman, <br>but it is
            equally important for older adults. Bones and muscles work together to support daily movements. <br>
            Physical
            activity
            strengthens muscles. Bones adapt by building more cells,<br> and as a result, both become stronger.
            <br>Strong
            bones
            and muscles
            protect against injury and improve balance and coordination. <br> In addition, active adults experience
            less
            joint stiffness
            and improved flexibility. <br> This becomes especially important with age, <br>it helps to prevent falls
            and
            the
            broken bones
            that may result. <br> For those with arthritis, <br> an exercise that keeps the muscles around the joint
            strong
            can
            act like a
            brace that will <br> react to movement without the use of an actual brace.[16]

        <p class="para">he ability to perform daily activities and maintain independence requires <br> strong muscles,
            balance, and
            endurance.
            Regular physical activity or <br> exercise helps to improve and prevent the decline of muscalking, getting
            up out
            of
            a chair <br>
            or leaning over to pick something up. Balance problems can reduce independence by <br>interfering with
            activities of
            daily
            living. Regular physical activity can improve balance and reduce the risk of falling. <br> Exercising
            regularly
            has many
            benefits for both your physical and mental health.</p>

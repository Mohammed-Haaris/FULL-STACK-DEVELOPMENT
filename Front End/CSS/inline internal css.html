      1.A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is
      designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. <br />2.It
      allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage
      the security and access controls for that database. <br />3.DBMS provides
      an environment to store and retrieve the data in convenient and efficient         
      manner.<br />4.Key Features of DBMS Data modeling: A DBMS provides tools
      for creating and modifying data models, which define the structure and
      relationships of the data in a and retrieving data from the database, and
      can provide various methods for searching and querying the data. <br />
      5.Concurrency control: A DBMS provides mechanisms for controlling
      concurrent access to the database, to ensure that multiple users can
      access the data without conflicting with each other. <br />
      6.Data integrity and security: A DBMS provides tools for enforcing data
      integrity and security constraints, such as constraints on the values of
      data and access controls that restrict who can access the data.
      <br />7.Backup and recovery: A DBMS provides mechanisms for backing up and
      recovering the data in the event of a system failure. <br />8.DBMS can be
      classified into two types: <br />
      <ol style="padding-left:250px;"><li style="color: greenyellow; font-size: xx-large;">
        Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)  </li> <li style="color: greenyellow;font-size: xx-large;">non-Relational
        Database Management System (NoSQL or Non-SQL)
      </li>
    </ol>
      <p style="font-size: xx-large; color: greenyellow;margin-left: 200px;">
        9.Data is organized in the form of tables and each table has a set of
      rows and columns. <br />10.The data are related to each other through
      primary and foreign keys. NoSQL: Data is organized in the form of
      key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or column-based. <br />11.These are
      designed to handle large-scale, high-performance scenarios.
